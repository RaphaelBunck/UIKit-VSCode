# Planned changes for Version 1.1.0
* Snippets will have a simple/class-only version as well as an extended/example version to choose from. <br /> E.g. `uk-container` for the class only, while `uk-container-sample` would give a `<div class="uk-container">` based on the examples from the official documentation.
* Possible indication of attributes/classes/example in each description

# Version 1.0.0 - 1.0.5 (As of March 2, 2017)
* Initial support for UIKit beta 3.0
* Minor tweaks to readme for consistency
* Added support for `php` files (Must be between `<?php ?>` tags for snippets to show up)
* Updated to UIKit 3.0.0-beta.16
* Added RTL snippet (Triggered with `uk-$-rtl`)
* Updated basic template snippet (`uk-$`) to include `uikit-icons.min.js`
* Updated many existing snippets (such as `uk-container` & `uk-section`) to be better formatted when inserted
